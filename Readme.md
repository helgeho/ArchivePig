## ArchivePig

An Apache Pig framework that facilitates access to Web Archives, enables easy data extraction as well as derivation.

### Description

When I had the idea for an efficient and easy-to-use framework to work with Web archives I implemented ArchivePig.
This is a fully functional implementation of that idea based on [Apache Pig](https://pig.apache.org).
Meanwhile, we have switched to [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org) though, and for that reason, ArchivePig is not being actively developed anymore.

Therefore, I recommend to use the new implementation, which you can find here: __[ArchiveSpark](https://github.com/helgeho/ArchiveSpark)__.
It is being actively developed and maintained and already now more mature than this.

However, if you prefer to use Pig over Spark, feel free to use and extend ArchivePig, any contributions are very much appreciated.
Examples on how to use ArchivePig are provided together with the corresponding outputs under [examples](examples).

__For more information on the approach please be referred to the [ArchiveSpark](https://github.com/helgeho/ArchiveSpark) project or get in touch with me.__
